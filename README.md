## Project: PID controller
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Introduction

This project uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller in order to drive a simulated car around a virtual track. The project involves implementing the controller primarily for the steering angle of the car as well as tuning coefficients for each PID value in order to calculate a steering angle that keeps the car on the track. The simulator provides cross-track error (CTE), speed, and steering angle data via local websocket.

## Components of PID

The P, or "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect on the car's behavior. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) to the car's distance from the lane center (which is the CTE) - CTE is essentially how far from the middle line of the road the car is. This makes sense, as if the car is to the left of the line then you would want to steer to the right; if it is far to the left of the middle with a high CTE then you want a higher steering angle. However, if the coefficient is set too high for P, the car will oscillate a ton, as the car will constantly overcorrect and overshoot the middle. If the coefficient is too low, the car may react too slowly to curves when the car gets off-center with a higher CTE.

The D, or "differential", component counteracts the P component's tendency to ring and overshoot the center line. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly without ringing.The "D" term is the change in CTE from one value to the next. This means that 1) if the derivative is quickly changing, the car will correct itself (i.e. higher steering angle) faster, such as in the case of a curve, and 2) if the car is moving outward from the middle, this will cause the steering to get larger (as the derivative sign will match the proportional sign), but if the car is moving toward the center (meaning the derivative value will be negative), the car's steering angle will get smoothed out, leading to a more smoother driving experience.

The I, or "integral", component counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias can take several forms, such as a steering drift. This term sums up all CTEs up to that point, such that too many negative CTEs (in this case, meaning the car has been to the left of the middle of the lane for awhile) will drive up this value, causing the car to turn back toward the middle, preventing the car from driving on one side of the lane the whole time.

## Tuning parameters

This project uses twiddle algorithm inside a state machine to optimize P and D parameters. The I parameter is for counteracting systematic bias and since we are in a simulator and not in a real world environment I concluded that there would not be any systematic bias. Hence I removed the I parameter and my car started driving smoother with expected angles.
